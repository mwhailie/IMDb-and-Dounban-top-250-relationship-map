# IMDB 250 Relationship Graph

Inspired by [低分电影宇宙](https://datamuse.guokr.com/wmu), I plotted this graph to show how [IMDb 250 top movies](https://www.imdb.com/chart/top/) are connected to each other by their actors and directors, using [D3's Disjoint Force-Directed Layout](https://observablehq.com/@d3/disjoint-force-directed-graph).
