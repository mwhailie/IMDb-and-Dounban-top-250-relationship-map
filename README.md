# IMDB 250 Relationship Graph

Inspired by [低分电影宇宙](https://datamuse.guokr.com/wmu), this project is to show how [IMDb top 250 movies](https://www.imdb.com/chart/top/) and [豆瓣电影 Top 250
](https://movie.douban.com/top250) are connected to each other by their actors and directors, using [D3's Disjoint Force-Directed Layout](https://observablehq.com/@d3/disjoint-force-directed-graph).
